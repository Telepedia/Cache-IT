**CacheIT** is a Cloudflare worker written in Typescript that controls caching on the Telepedia Platform. It is responsible for deciding when a page should -- or should not -- be cached,
and doing so accordingly. 

This worker is based on the Deltarune/Undertale Yellow worker of the same nature with some modifications for the Telepedia Platform. The original can be found [here](https://github.com/utdrwiki/cache-worker)
